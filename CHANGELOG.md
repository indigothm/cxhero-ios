# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - Support for Scheduled Triggers, Attempt Tracking, and Modern UI

### Added

#### Scheduled/Delayed Triggers
- **`scheduleAfterSeconds`** field on `EventTrigger` to delay survey presentation after event matches
- **Persistent scheduling** - scheduled surveys survive app relaunch/termination
- `ScheduledSurveyStore` actor to manage persistent survey scheduling
- Automatic restoration of pending scheduled surveys on app launch
- Cleanup of old scheduled surveys (24 hours by default)
- **Debug mode override** - automatically use 10-second delays in DEBUG builds for rapid testing

#### Attempt Tracking
- **`maxAttempts`** field on `SurveyRule` to limit number of presentation attempts
- **`attemptCooldownSeconds`** field on `SurveyRule` for re-attempt specific cooldowns
- Attempt counter tracking in `SurveyGatingStore`
- **`completedOnce`** flag to distinguish between dismissals and completions
- Surveys stop showing once `maxAttempts` is reached, even if not completed
- Surveys marked as completed won't show again, even if under `maxAttempts`

#### Multi-Question Combined Surveys
- **New `combined` response type** - show rating buttons + optional text field in one survey
- **SelectableRatingButton** component with selected state highlighting
- **Explicit submit button** - prevents accidental submissions
- **Optional text fields** - text input can be required or optional
- **TextFieldConfig** for configuring text field behavior (label, placeholder, validation)
- **Combined response parsing** - format: `"Option||DetailedText"` with delimiter
- **Smart validation** - rating required, text optional (or required if configured)

#### Modern Survey UI
- **Professional, brand-agnostic design** with clean typography and spacing
- **Full light/dark mode support** - adapts automatically to system appearance
- **Emoji rating system** - smart emoji mapping based on option labels:
  - Poor/Bad/1 → 😞
  - Fair/Okay/2 → 😐
  - Good/3 → 🙂
  - Great/Very Good/4 → 😊
  - Excellent/Amazing/5 → 🤩
  - Numeric 1-10 ratings map intelligently
- **Card-based rating buttons** with:
  - Subtle shadows and rounded corners
  - Press animations for tactile feedback
  - Selection highlighting with accent color
  - Responsive layout that adapts to screen size
- **Improved text input** with:
  - Clean rounded corners
  - Character counter
  - Better placeholder styling
  - Full-width submit button
- **Close button** in top-right corner
- **ScrollView support** for long content
- **Accessible colors** optimized for both light and dark modes
- **iOS 14+ compatibility** with iOS 16+ optimizations

#### New Behaviors
- Survey dismissal without completion increments attempt counter
- Survey completion marks survey as done and cancels any pending scheduled instances
- Scheduled surveys are cancelled when starting a new session
- Triggered surveys that missed their window (app was closed) show immediately on app relaunch
